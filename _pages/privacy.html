  {% regionblock privacy_policy_header4, type: header %}

  {% endregionblock %}
  {% regionblock privacy_policy_content5, type: text %}

  {% endregionblock %}
  {% regionblock privacy_policy_header5, type: header %}
    <h4>How we will use information about you</h4>
  {% endregionblock %}
  {% regionblock privacy_policy_content6, type: text %}
    <p>We will only use your personal information when the law allows us to. Most commonly, we will use your personal information in the following circumstances:</p>
  {% endregionblock %}
  {% regionblock privacy_policy_content7, type: text %}
    <ul>
      <li>1. Where we need to perform the contract we have entered into with you.</li>
      <li>2. Where we need to comply with a legal obligation.</li>
      <li>3. Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests.</li>
      <li>4. Where you have given us explicit consent to do so.</li>
    </ul>
  {% endregionblock %}
  {% regionblock privacy_policy_content8, type: text %}
    <p>We may also use your personal information in the following situations, which are likely to be rare:</p>
  {% endregionblock %}
  {% regionblock privacy_policy_content9, type: text %}
    <ul>
      <li>1. Where we need to protect your interests (or someone else's interests).</li>
      <li>2. Where it is needed in the public interest or for official purposes or requested for by the CBI, police or governmental authorities.</li>
    </ul>
  {% endregionblock %}
  {% regionblock privacy_policy_header6, type: header %}
    <h4>Situations in which we will use your personal information</h4>
  {% endregionblock %}
  {% regionblock privacy_policy_content10, type: text %}
    <p>We need all the categories of information in the list above primarily to allow us to perform our contract with you and to enable us to comply with legal obligations. In some cases, we may use your personal information to pursue legitimate interests of our own or those of third parties</p>
    <p>There are "special categories" of more sensitive personal data which require a higher level of protection.</p>
    <p>Business management and planning, including accounting and auditing.</p>
    <p>Making decisions about grievances.</p>
    <p>Making arrangements for the termination of a contract.</p>
    <p>Dealing with legal disputes and insurance claims.</p>

    <p>To conduct data analytics studies to review and better understand customer satisfaction and needs.</p>
    <p>Some of the above grounds for processing will overlap and there may be several grounds which justify our use of your personal information.</p>
  {% endregionblock %}
  {% regionblock privacy_policy_header7, type: header %}
    <h4>If you fail to provide personal information</h4>
  {% endregionblock %}
  {% regionblock privacy_policy_content11, type: text %}
    <p>If you fail to provide certain information when requested, we may not be able to perform the contract we have entered into with you (such as providing a benefit), or we may be prevented from complying with our legal obligations (such as to ensure the health and safety or proof of nationality for example passport) </p>
  {% endregionblock %}
  {% regionblock privacy_policy_header8, type: header %}
    <h4>Change of purpose</h4>
  {% endregionblock %}
  {% regionblock privacy_policy_content12, type: text %}
    <p>We will only use your personal information for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If we need to use your personal information for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.</p>
    <p>Please note that we may process your personal information without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.</p>
  {% endregionblock %}
  {% regionblock privacy_policy_header9, type: header %}
    <h4>How we use particularly sensitive personal information</h4>
  {% endregionblock %}
  {% regionblock privacy_policy_content13, type: text %}
    <p>"Special categories" of particularly sensitive personal information require higher levels of protection. We need to have further justification for collecting, storing and using this type of personal information. We may process special categories of personal information in the following circumstances:</p>
  {% endregionblock %}
  {% regionblock privacy_policy_content14, type: text %}
    <ul>
      <li>1. In limited circumstances, with your explicit written consent.</li>
      <li>2. Where we need to carry out our legal obligations</li>
      <li>3. Where it is needed in the public interest, such as for requested for by CBI, police or governmental authorities</li>
  </ul>
  {% endregionblock %}
  {% regionblock privacy_policy_content15, type: text %}
    <p>Less commonly, we may process this type of information where it is needed in relation to legal claims or where it is needed to protect your interests (or someone else's interests) and you are not capable of giving your consent, or where you have already made the information public.</p>
  {% endregionblock %}
  {% regionblock privacy_policy_header10, type: header %}
    <h4>Principles of GDPR</h4>
  {% endregionblock %}
  {% regionblock privacy_policy_content16, type: text %}
    <p>We will use your personal data only in-line with the following principles:</p>
  {% endregionblock %}
  {% regionblock privacy_policy_content17, type: text %}
    <ul>
      <li>1. Lawfulness, fairness and transparency</li>
      <li>2. Purpose limitation</li>
      <li>3. Data minimisation</li>
      <li>4. Accuracy</li>
      <li>5. Storage limitation</li>
      <li>6. Integrity and confidentiality</li>
    </ul>
  {% endregionblock %}
  {% regionblock privacy_policy_content18, type: text %}
    <p>This is the only principle that deals explicitly with security. The GDPR states that personal data must be &ldquo;processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical or organisational measures&rdquo;.</p>
    <p>The GDPR is deliberately vague about what measures organisations should take, because technological and organisational best practices are constantly changing. Currently, organisations should encrypt and/or pseudonymise personal data wherever possible, but they should also consider whatever other options are suitable.</p>
  {% endregionblock %}
  {% regionblock privacy_policy_header11, type: header %}
    <h4>Do we need your consent?</h4>
  {% endregionblock %}
  {% regionblock privacy_policy_content19, type: text %}
    <p>We do not need your consent if we use special categories of your personal information in accordance with our written policy to carry out our legal obligations or exercise specific rights. In limited circumstances, we may approach you for your written consent to allow us to process certain particularly sensitive data. If we do so, we will provide you with full details of the information that we would like and the reason we need it, so that you can carefully consider whether you wish to consent. You should be aware that it is not a condition of your contract with us that you agree to any request for consent from us.</p>
  {% endregionblock %}
  {% regionblock privacy_policy_header12, type: header %}
    <h4>Automated decision-making</h4>
  {% endregionblock %}
  {% regionblock privacy_policy_content20, type: text %}
    <p>Automated decision-making takes place when an electronic system uses personal information to make a decision without human intervention.</p>
    <p>We do not envisage that any decisions will be taken about you using automated means, however we will notify you in writing if this position changes.</p>
  {% endregionblock %}
  {% regionblock privacy_policy_header13, type: header %}
    <h4>Data sharing</h4>
  {% endregionblock %}
  {% regionblock privacy_policy_content21, type: text %}
    <p>We may have to share your data with third parties, including third-party service providers and other entities in the IHCL Group.</p>

  {% endregionblock %}
  {% regionblock privacy_policy_header14, type: header %}
    <h4>Why might you share my personal information with third parties?</h4>
  {% endregionblock %}
  {% regionblock privacy_policy_content22, type: text %}
    <p>We will share your personal information with third parties where required by law, or where we have another legitimate interest in doing so, or when we have your explicit consent.</p>
  {% endregionblock %}
  {% regionblock privacy_policy_header15, type: header %}
    <h4>Which third-party service providers process my personal information?</h4>
  {% endregionblock %}
  {% regionblock privacy_policy_content23, type: text %}
    <p>"Third parties" includes third-party service providers (including contractors and designated agents) and other entities within our group</p>
  {% endregionblock %}
  {% regionblock privacy_policy_header16, type: header %}
    <h4>How secure is my information with third-party service providers and other entities in our group?</h4>
  {% endregionblock %}
  {% regionblock privacy_policy_content24, type: text %}
    <p>All our third-party service providers and other entities in the group are required to take appropriate security measures to protect your personal information in line with our policies. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes.

  {% endregionblock %}
  {% regionblock privacy_policy_header19, type: header %}
    <h4>Transferring information outside the EU</h4>
  {% endregionblock %}
  {% regionblock privacy_policy_content27, type: text %}
    <p>We will transfer the personal information we collect about you to our global headquarters in India in order to perform our contract with you, or with your explicit consent.</p>
    <p>There is no an adequacy decision by the European Commission in respect of that country. This means that the country to which we transfer your data is not deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for your personal information.</p>
    <p>To ensure that your personal information does receive an adequate level of protection we have put in place the strong inter country security measures to ensure that your personal information is treated by those third parties in a way that is consistent with and which respects the EU and UK laws on data protection: Pursuant to GDPR article 3(2) and article 27</p>
  {% endregionblock %}
  {% regionblock privacy_policy_header20, type: header %}

    <p>We have put in place measures to protect the security of your information.</p>
    <p>Third parties will only process your personal information on our instructions and where they have agreed to treat the information confidentially, legally and securely.</p>
    <p>We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal information from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal information to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal information on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.</p>

  {% endregionblock %}
  {% regionblock privacy_policy_header21, type: header %}
    <h4>Data retention</h4>
  {% endregionblock %}
  {% regionblock privacy_policy_content29, type: text %}
    <p>How long will you use my information for?</p>
    <p>We will only retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.</p>
    <p>In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal information so that it can no longer be associated with you, in which case we may use such information without further statment to you.</p>
  {% endregionblock %}
  {% regionblock privacy_policy_header22, type: header %}
    <h4>Rights of access, correction, erasure, and restriction</h4>
  {% endregionblock %}
  {% regionblock privacy_policy_content30, type: text %}
    <p>Your duty to inform us of changes</p>
    <p>It is important that the personal information we hold about you is accurate and current. Please keep us informed if your personal information changes during your relationship with us.</p>
  {% endregionblock %}
  {% regionblock privacy_policy_header23, type: header %}
    <h4>Your rights in connection with personal information</h4>
  {% endregionblock %}
  {% regionblock privacy_policy_content31, type: text %}
    <p>Under certain circumstances, by law you have the right to:</p>
    <p>Request access to your personal information (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal information we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</p>
    <p>Request correction of the personal information that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about you corrected.</p>
    <p>Request erasure of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal information where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal information where you have exercised your right to object to processing (see below).</p>
    <p>Object to processing of your personal information where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal information for direct marketing purposes.</p>
    <p>Request the restriction of processing of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of personal information about you, for example if you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it.</p>
    <p>If you want to review, verify, correct or request erasure of your personal information, object to the processing of your personal data, or request that we transfer a copy of your personal information to another party, please contact <a href="mailto:dpo@tajhotels.com">dpo@tajhotels.com</a> in writing.</p>
    <p>No fee is usually required</p>
    <p>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal information (or to exercise any of the other rights).

  {% endregionblock %}
  {% regionblock privacy_policy_header24, type: header %}
    <h4>What we may need from you</h4>
  {% endregionblock %}
  {% regionblock privacy_policy_content32, type: text %}
    <p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access the information (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is another appropriate security measure to ensure that personal information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.</p>
  {% endregionblock %}
  {% regionblock privacy_policy_header25, type: header %}
    <h4>Right to withdraw consent</h4>
  {% endregionblock %}
  {% regionblock privacy_policy_content33, type: text %}
