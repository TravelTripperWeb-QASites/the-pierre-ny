        <p> In the British Raj, where the British custom of afternoon tea was supplanted by the local Indian practice of taking a light meal at that hour, it came to be called tiffin. It is derived from English colloquial or slang tiffing meaning to take a
          little drink, and had by 1867 become naturalized among Anglo-Indians in the north of British India to mean luncheon. </p>
        <p> We look forward to sharing this beloved tradition with our Afternoon Tea Program by offering a selection of small bites with Indian & Raj flair, and homemade sweets that compliment spiced Chai tea </p>
