Candidates for the rating undergo multiple anonymous, in-person property evaluations and a final decision by a panel of experts.

          <p tabindex="0">Since 2013, The Pierre has been recognized with the prestigious Forbes Travel Guide Five-Star Rating, which has been the gold standard in hospitality for nearly 60 years. The distinction is awarded annually to fewer than 60 properties throughout the United States. A team of expert inspectors anonymously evaluate properties against up to 800 rigorous and objective standards. These standards are the most stringent in the industry — Forbes inspectors travel incognito, staying two nights and three days to gather every detail of the visit.</p>
          <p>The Pierre is the only Forbes Five-Star and AAA Five Diamond property on Manhattan's Upper East Side.</p>
