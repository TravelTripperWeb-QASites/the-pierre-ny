            <p><span class="italic">"We have many couples who are continuing a family tradition by hosting their wedding at The Pierre. They come to us not only for our iconic spaces, but for our highly experienced in-house team.  For one bride, our chefs drove to a pumpkin patch on Long Island to fulfill her  request for pumpkin soup served in a rustic, autumnal plating style. After handpicking 150 pumpkins, they returned to the hotel to turn them into serving vessels for the soup."</span></p>
            <p>Prior to joining the hotel, Bill worked at iconic venues including Windows on the World, the Rainbow Room and Cipriani.  A graduate of the Hospitality School at Penn State, Bill is an active member of the Chaine de Rotisseurs, NY Wine and Food Society, James Beard Foundation and the National Association of Catering Executives.</p>
