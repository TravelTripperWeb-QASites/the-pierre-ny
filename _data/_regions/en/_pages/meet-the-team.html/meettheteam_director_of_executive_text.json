Raised in a family of restaurateurs near Kerala, India, Chef Ashfer earned his hospitality degree in India. His career has taken him all over the globe&mdash;from the Culinary Institute of America to kitchens in Napa Valley, the Maldives, Jean-Georges in London and Southeast Asia. Chef Ashfer enjoys working with couples to create a truly customized, unique wedding menu.</p>\n<p><span class=\"italic\">\"For one bride, our chefs drove to a pumpkin patch on Long Island to fulfill her request for pumpkin soup served in a rustic, autumnal plating style. After handpicking 150 pumpkins, we returned to the hotel to turn them into serving vessels for the soup. We take pride in incorporating fresh ingredients and are fortunate because we have so many sustainable options to choose from here in New York.\"</span></p>\n<p>In addition to leading culinary operations for The Pierre's banquet spaces, Chef Ashfer oversees Perrine, The Rotunda and Two E Bar &amp; Lounge, managing a team of 50 cooks and seven sous chefs that, during the hotel's busy season, serve up to 5,000 people per day.</p>\n<p>Follow Chef Ashfer on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ashferbiju\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Twitter</a>&nbsp;and Instagram: <a title=\"Instagram\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/ashferbiju/\">https://www.instagram.com/ashferbiju/</a></p>",
